title:  Learning the art of code.

Finding a balance between artistic and analytical outlets can be tough. That's where code comes in. It gives me the ability to create something that is at once beautiful and logical, which is downright satisfying and completely addictive. I've started on a journey to become proficient in code, and will be posting my progress here.

I’d tossed around the idea of learning to code for ages. After countless times of sitting down at my computer and bailing just before hitting that big button that seemed to say “Big Commitment”, I asked myself, “Why is this so damn scary?” 
 
So, instead of taking a few minutes to hyperventilate into a paper bag, I clicked that button and haven’t looked back. Because after starting on Learn Verified I realized something big; it wasn’t that button that was so terrifying after all, it was the thought of failing. And if coding has taught me anything it’s that failure isn’t something to be scared of at all - it’s what helps you determine your next steps.

I got my first degree in Wildlife Biology and Conservation, but soon grew tired of field work and research. In an effort to merge both arts and science into a sort of super-job, I took up a position as a Biological Photographer. Many, many hours of photographing dead specimens turned into a real love for photography (and a realization that spiders are still just as scary when dead). So, I went on the Conestoga College for a diploma course in Photography.
 
Several years later I found myself at that same crossroads of wanting to combine a love of art and a passion for math and science into a 'dream job', and after continuously finding myself looking through magazines on coding and technology decided to take the plunge. A few months of research led me to Flatiron and their Learn Verified Program in which I am currently enrolled. I enlisted in their free Intro to Ruby trial and found the lessons both extremely addictive and informative.
 
Coding has thus far been the most fulfilling pursuit that I have undertaken. I look forward to sitting down at my computer every day and creating something both impactful and effective.
