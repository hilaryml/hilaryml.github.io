Learning to code hasn't just provided me with a new skill-set, it's completely revamped my everyday mindset.

One of the more obvious lessons that coding provides is not to fear failure. Though this is a mantra that is introduced early on, it definitely takes a while to actually believe it. I suppose relieving the terror associated with failure that we all had instilled in us at a pretty young age (thanks, school) is not an easy task.

A more subtle version of this lesson lies in the realization that it takes a much stronger, a much wiser person to be able to recognize when they have made a mistake, admit to it, and proceed to fix it (without attaching any sort of negative emotions to it).

Applying these mantras to everyday life has really changed the way I perceive not only myself, but those around me. It's taken the stress out of everyday mishaps, and I have an even greater respect for those who are able to shake off mistakes and turn things around without missing a beat.

This means shifting your mindset from seeing a bug/failure/mistake as a fault against you, and perceiving them instead as a puzzle to be solved, or another opportunity to learn and be even more awesome than you already are. It's a really freeing concept once it sinks in.

I'm incredibly grateful to the Learn Program for not only providing me with some super cool tools to make crazy awesome things, but for providing me with a mindset that's more capable of dealing with set-backs, obstacles, and any other challenges life decides to throw at me.
