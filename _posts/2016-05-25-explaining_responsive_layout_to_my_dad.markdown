Explaining anything technological to your parents can be a little trying on your patience, particularly when you are met with questions like, "How do I put a circle around the letter 'a' for email addresses?"

With this in mind, the thought of explaining Responsive Layout to my Dad was a little intimidating.

> "How do I put a circle around the letter 'a' for email addresses?"


My first venture into this assignment started with a very tentative question, 

"Sooo.... Dad. About those canoeing forums... Are they pretty?" 

"Uh. No?" 

"Would you like it if they were?" 

"... That'd be nice." 

And so it begins!


Alrighty then. Responsive Layout is a technique used to help websites look great and keep them just as functional and efficient no matter what device you are using to look at them. (Whether it's Mom's Laptop, or the tablet you somehow haven't managed to break yet).

### There are a few key things to know about how a Responsive Layout is built:

1. There are these neat little things called "CSS Media Queries" that check to see what the screen size of your device is, and then they adjust what the website looks like so that it fits your screen. 
2. In order to make sure that all of those super-cool canoeing-at-sunset-pics and videos adjust to your screen size, developers set them to what's called "fluid widths". You can also set things like tables, audio, and any forms that need to be filled out to fluid widths too!
3. Developers will also set all the text on the webpage to what is called "em size" (which we won't go into detail about here, but just know that this will make the text adjustable too!)
4. As you know, there are some pretty small screens out there, as well as some pretty freakin' huge ones. Developers can set stopping and starting points so that the Responsive Layout only kicks in for certain screen sizes so that the webpage doesn't get frustratingly small, or distortingly stretched out.


At the end of the day, Responsive Layout makes websites both visually appealing and effective no matter what device they are being viewed on - so say goodbye to those pesky horizontal scrollbars! Trust me, you won't miss 'em.
