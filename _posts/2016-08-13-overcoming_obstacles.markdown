Keeping an eye on the question bar at the side of our Learn page can tell you a lot of things.

Firstly, that most of us don't like to ask questions. Secondly, that we don't often like to supply a lot of information about the problem that we are experiencing. Interestingly enough, these tendencies are actually related to our psychology.

**Programming Psych 101**

Often times, when you are stuck at a programming barrier, you know that figuring it out yourself will be far more liberating and can help you to learn much more from the problem than if you had received help. But how do you know when you've crossed that invisible line between self-improvement and self-sabotage. Research has found that programmers are not only apprehensive to ask for help, but also prefer to seek help from an anonymous source rather than their coworkers or peers [1]. Not only that, but when a problem is reported, it is often lacking in sufficient detail [2].

These habits tend to stem from a fear of judgement in their abilities as coders. They are often seen in coders that still feel that failure is a sign of weakness, that it is something to feel ashamed or embarrassed about.

Here at Learn, we are taught differently. Early on we are exposed to the mantra that "Failure isn't something to fear." They tell us that when you stop failing, you are no longer programming. And that programming part? Yeah, that's your job. And you can't be scared to do your job forever. At some point, you've got to set your ego aside and ask yourself, "Am I only avoiding help to save face?" If the answer is yes, then suck it up and open up that question bar. Afterall, I have never caught myself thinking those same condescending thoughts that I fear I will receive from others. And if anyone does think you are being weak when you ask them for help, then they are just being a butt. Period. Take a look at that little heart prompt in your terminal. Let it remind you that we are all here to help and support one another.

> "Failure isn't something to fear."

I see these habits in myself, and though I believe that trying to solve a problem by myself can help to develop my independence and confidence as a coder, I also know that I need to be honest with my own short-comings and seek help when I need it. Otherwise, I'm not encouraging my own growth, I'm inhibiting it.
